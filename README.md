Since I have no idea what the meaning is "using Unity to draw shapes", so I made the challenge in 2 ways.
The MeshBasedShape scene is using Meshs to draw the shapes.
The SpriteBasedShape scene is using Sprites to make the shapes.

The MeshBasedShape scene made by those basic requirement.
While the SpriteBasedShape scene is more like a game.

SpriteBasedShape Game Instruction:

Before time runs out, click in the middle.  
After clicked it will switch to a random color and a random shape.
If the color and shape is matching the color and shape on the top, then wait the time to run out to win this game.
